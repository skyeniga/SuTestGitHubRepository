			<!-- Original 22 table tags version, structured on isolating independent multiple relationships, discontinued. -->
			<xs:enumeration value="2.0"/>
			<!--
			Starting with 2.0 business and person elements were eliminated, resulting in a 20 table tags version of SBA_ETran. 
			As of 2.0, business and person data is passed with the borrower, guarantor or principal elements, along with the 
			tag: <BusPerInd>B</BusPerInd> or <BusPerInd>P</BusPerInd>. This element replaces the prior tags BorrBusPerInd, 
			GuarBusPerInd and PrinBusPerInd. The other change is simplifying the address elements to remove the prefix 'Bus' 
			or 'Per'. For example, BusPhyAddrStCd is now PhyAddrStCd. This can now be inferred from BusPerInd. 
			-->
			<xs:enumeration value="2.3"/>
			<!--
			2.3 further simplifies SBA_ETran, through the use of more English-like names. Otherwise, it's the same as 2.0. 
			-->
			<xs:enumeration value="3.0"/>
			<!--
			For Loan Origination, 3.0 is the same as 2.3. But 3.0 is significant in that it's the first version that supports 
			Loan Servicing. In Loan Servicing, there are more actions allowed a new table for Disbursement, and some behavioral 
			differences: When action="update", not coding an element means "keep its value the same", but coding <tag></tag> 
			means "erase its data" (in database terminology, NULL). For data elements that don't allow NULL, the Loan Servicing 
			XSD uses SBA_Mand datatypes to prevent <tag></tag>. 
			
			Since the SBA_ETran version attribute's default ("fixed") is 1.0, Loan Servicing E-Tran XML must specify the 
			version attribute in the root element SBA_ETran, and that version must be at least 3.0. 
			-->
			<xs:enumeration value="3.2"/>
			<!--
			3.2 simplifies the XML somewhat by moving BusinessPrincipal data to Principal. Recommended for all new development. 
			-->
			<xs:enumeration value="3.3"/>
			<!--
			3.3 makes it clearer which participants are persons, adds a new type of particpant (Associate) to Loan 
			Servicing and adds 3 new international address elements (country code, postal code and state name). The 
			international address elements were originally for persons only. But with version 3.4's added support for 
			international address elements for business, this restriction was relaxed in 3.3. Now international address 
			elements may be given for both businesses and persons in 3.3. Also only in Servicing, for borrowers, guarantors 
			and principals (but not associates), there are new outlaw code and description elements. Also only in Servicing, 
			the Loan element now allows action="locate", meaning that the Loan element is being used only to identify which 
			loan other changes apply to. (That is, you're not trying to update financial information associated with the 
			loan.) When action="locate" is given, the only allowable subelements are LoanApplicNmb (SBA application number) 
			or LoanNmb (SBA loan number). If both are given, they must match the same loan (optional safeguard technique).

			<!--
			Servicing type for 503 Pool Loans. Colson feed only. Not for use by lenders. 
			-->
			<xs:enumeration value="3.4"/>
			<!--
			3.4 adds an element for whether or not the lender is allowed to make loans outside of the their area of 
			operations, ARC reasons for ARC loans in Loan Orignination, DUNS numbers for businesses, and international 
			address fields (country code, postal code and state name) for both businesses and persons. (As a result, 
			international address elements are now allowed for both businesses and persons in version 3.3 as well.)

			<xs:enumeration value="3.4i"/>
			<xs:enumeration value="3.4p"/>
			<!--
			3.4c ("credit"), 3.4i ("internal") and 3.4p ("pool") are mostly the same as 3.4, but are used in SBA 
			internal processes only. Not for use by lenders. Version specifics: 
			3.4c	a superset of 3.4 that adds 6 credit scoring elements for 3.4 submissions that originate 
					from within the SBA. 
			3.4i	a subset of 3.4 that represent permitted optional changes that may be applied at the time 
					as an SBA underwriting decision is made. 
			3.4p	a very small subset of 3.4 for 503 pooled loans. 
			-->
			<xs:enumeration value="3.5"/>
			<!--
			Makes certain lender-related elements optional for direct loan applications (processing methods where the SBA 
			is the lender). The same elements remain mandatory for lenders and other processing methods. Adds support for 
			multiple eligibility questions, change of asset ownership, Community Advantage Initiative and a more generalized 
			way to specify reasons. (LoanReason elements are required for restricted processing methods to specify why that 
			processing method is being used and/or justified for a given loan application, as sometimes defined by Congress.) 
			-->
			<xs:enumeration value="3.6"/>
			<!--
			Fixes an orphaned complexType for change of asset ownership. Redefines Comments from multiple occurrences with 
			maxLength="255" (SBA_Str255) into one big xs:string without any xs:restriction. This eliminates the previous 
			need to have a sequence number, which has been removed in 3.6. 
			-->
			<xs:enumeration value="3.7"/>
			<!--
			Changes to allow 2 phases of interest: LoanApplication.InterestStructureCd, Loan.InterestStructureCd, Interest 
			element and subelements of Interest. Removal of old single-phase elements in LoanApplication and Loan. 
			Addition of new elements: Collateral.CollateralSubtypCd, Guarantor.GuaranteeTypCd, Principal.VetCertInd and 
			LoanApplication.LimitExemptionInd. 
			For details, see SBA_ETran.3.7.orig.xsd and SBA_ETran.3.7.serv.xsd. 
			-->
			<xs:enumeration value="3.8"/>
			<!--
			Adds LoanApplication.UnderwritingBy element to allow a lenders to renounce direct authority to approve an application. 
			For use with any origination XML interface except OrigBypass, OrigUpdate or Underwriting. 
			-->
			<xs:enumeration value="3.8i"/>
			<!--
			For use with the OrigUpdate and Underwriting Web Services. Contains fewer elements than 3.8. 
			-->
			<xs:enumeration value="3.9"/>
			<!--
			When entering the ChangeOfOwnership element, the qualifications of the business appraiser have now been moved to a 
			separate BusAppr element to represent a database-driven one-to-many relationship. Also, 3.9 contains the first 
			documentation of the BorrowerRace element (for disaster loan applications only). 
			Added new element LoanApplication.AgentInvolved. 
			-->
			<xs:enumeration value="4.0"/>
			<!--
			This version is not yet officially supported. It represents the "grand unification" version that will be usable by ALL 
			Origination web services. It's capable of being used by "new app" web services (currently, Originate3 and OrigScore), 
			but can also be used by "existing app" web services (currently, OrigUpdate and Underwriting). The same XML version now 
			supports them all. This implies coding differences by submission context that will be very familiar to users of the 
			Servicing web services for existing loans. 

			CODING DIFFERENCES ASSOCIATED WITH SUBMISSION CONTEXT AND VERSION: 
			(1)	Because Underwriting may use 4.0, 4.0 must allow LiquidCredit elements (LiquidCreditScore, CreditReport and CreditScore). 
				But those elements may be given ONLY by SBA Reviewers. Anyone who submits 4.0 XML with any LiquidCredit element, but 
				who is NOT an SBA Reviewer, will get an error. 
			(2)	Because "new app" web services may use 4.0, 4.0 must allow ProcessingMethodCd, PartnerInformation and LocationId. But 
				once an app exists, they cannot be changed (neither in web pages, nor by XML). Therefore, "existing app" web services 
				may not give those 3 elements. Doing so will result in an error. 
			(3)	Regardless of whether due to web page or web service processing, once a lender has elected to have an app underwritten 
				by the SBA, that election is irrevocable for that app. Therefore, existing app web services may not contain the 
				UnderwritingBy element with the value LNDR once the app is marked as SBA underwritten. (It may, however, be given with 
				the value SBA.) 
			(4)	All group elements other than LoanApplication: "New app" web services never need to give action="insert" on those group 
				elements (for example, Borrower, UseOfProceeds, etc), because action="insert" was assumed. That was also true of 
				"existing app" web services using previous XML versions. (Those same group elements were predeleted to allow reinsertion 
				from scratch.) But as of version 4.0, all group elements other than LoanApplication have "prime keys", a database term 
				for data elements that uniquely specify which row in the database is to be processed. As a result, such group elements 
				are NOT predeleted and, in most cases, may specify action="update" or action="delete". This is the most significant 
				coding difference introduced in version 4.0. Only users of "existing app" web services who switch to version 4.0 are 
				affected. 
			(5)	If all elements in a group element (complexType) are part of the prime key, there's no way to accomplish action="update", 
				so that action has to be disallowed. BorrowerRace, BusAppr, PrincipalRace, SpecialPurpose and UnderservedMarket fall 
				into that category. That's because you can't give the same code element twice, once as a prime key and then again with a 
				different value for it to contain. For those 5 complexTypes, you must give 2 instances of the complexType: Use 
				action="delete" on the instance with the old code value and use action="insert" on the instance with the new code value. 
			(6)	BorrPhnNmb is eliminated. (It was an old Borrower element that was made redundant by the PrimaryPhone element introduced 
				in version 3.5 for Borrower, Guarantor and Principal.) This is a "breaking change". BorrPhnNmb may no longer be given. 
			-->
			<xs:enumeration value="5.0"/>
			<!--
			Changes documented in SBA_ETranTypes.xsd (this file): 
			(1)	Added a new enumeration value "AD" to SBA_OrigStatCd (part of the SBA_Etran_Response). 
			(2)	Added a new enumeration value "deleteall" to 2 of the SBA_Actions simpleTypes (allowing "delete-and-insert logic"). 
				Only useful when updating an existing app (OrigUpdate and Underwriting web services). 
			Changes documented in SBA_ETran.5.0.orig.xsd (Origination): 
			(2)	Added many new child elements to LoanApplication, Borrower, Collateral, Guarantor, Injection, Principal and UseOfProceeds. 
				Added new element StandbyAgreement with 8 child elements. 
				Added new child element ControlInterestType to Borrower and Principal. 
			(3)	Removed AffiliatedInd child elements from Borrower, Guarantor and Principal. 
				Removed long-deprecated (for 3 years) child elements associated with street addresses (all ending in "StrtNmb" and "SuffixName"). 
			(4)	Renamed all existing Collateral child elements with "Collateral" prefix to remove that prefix, except CollateralSequenceNmb. 
				(CollateralSequenceNmb is needed to establish the link between a Collateral item and its CollateralLiens, so it must retain prefix.) 
				Shortened some other Collateral child element names with abbreviations, both for consistency and to lessen XML overhead. 
				Renamed Guarantor.GuaranteeTypCd to Guarantor.GntyTypCd,                both for consistency and to lessen XML overhead. 
			(5)	Better organized all container elements with child elements to list prime key elements first, then data elements alphabetically. 
				Better documented how some data      elements are mandatory when action="insert" but optional  when action="update" or action="delete". 
				Better documented how some prime key elements are ignored   when action="insert" but mandatory when action="update" or action="delete". 
				Better documented how SequenceNmb elements are allocated (sequentially, starting from 1) when they become prime keys after insert.
